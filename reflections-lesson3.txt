Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One reason might be when I know I would be using other systems to continue on my work rather than the present system. The remote
repository would keep track of all my commits, and would be clonable wherever and whatever system I am using. I would be able to
edit the files directly on the github website like now even.
One more reason would be if I think I would like to collaborate on the project with more people.
Git, for syncing with github, uses what is called a remote. This is short for remote repository. Before pushing a local repository
on to github, it needs to be in the form of a remote repository. 
  git remote
The above command shows all the remotes existing in the repository presently.
  git remote <remote_name> <github repo url>
This creates a new remote for the local repo and sets the url to which the repository will be pushed or pulled from
  git push remote_name branch_name
pushes branch_name to remote_name through the url which was specified earlier.
  git remote -v
gives out verbose message about remotes and their link urls.
